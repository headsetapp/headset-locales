# Headset Locales

Headset-locales is the official repository for [Headset](http://headsetapp.co) locale files. These files are used to
localize the `core` and `wrapper` parts of Headset.
English and Spanish are the two officially supported languages for Headset, all other languages are maintain by the
community.

The following is the status of the current locale files:

| Locale code | Locale | Progress |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| en | English | complete |
| es | Spanish | complete |
| de | German  | complete |

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Run `npm run fix *LOCALE_CODE*` <sup>1</sup>

    Notice that you need to add a locale code by replacing `*LOCALE_CODE*` with your own.
    You can pass multiple locales separated by a space, i.e. `fr es-MX po`.

    All required files will be created under `locales/core` and `locales/wrapper`, with all keys filled with a `__NOT_TRANSLATED__` default value.

3. Translate as many keys as possible. <sup>2</sup>
4. Run `npm run ready`
5. Submit a PR!

[1]: We use a two-letter code to represent the locale, following [ISO639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) rules. If you want to add a locale specific to a country, as in US English (en-US) or Mexican Spanish (es-MX), use the two-letter language code follow by a hyphen, follow by the country's two-letter code capitalized.
The two-letter country code follows [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) rules.

[2] Don't worry if you can't do them all, the ones not translated will use English as backup. The `ready` script will remove all the `__NOT_TRANSLATED__` values that you couldn't do.
